Repository for code and data analysis associated with Thailand carbon stock estimation in Krabi Mangrove Forest and the Pak Phanang Mangrove Forest

Author: Jacob J. Bukoski

Research questions:

  1. Is dominant species a significant predictor of carbon stocks in mangroves?

Goals:

  1. Quantify differences in carbon stocks, species composition and forest structure between Pak Phanang and Krabi River Estuary mangrove forests
  2. Test for significant effect of species composition on aboveground and belowground carbon stocks
  3. Test for control of distance on carbon stocks in mangroves

Data analysis plan:

  1. Quantify component specific carbon stocks in Pak Phanang and Krabi River Estuary (site level)
  2. Subplot-level measures of forest structure, biomass and carbon stocks -- test for significant effects of species composition, forest structure, and distance from water

Ancillary goals:

  1. R package for mangrove allometry
  2. Publish tree-level dataset in Data Dryad
